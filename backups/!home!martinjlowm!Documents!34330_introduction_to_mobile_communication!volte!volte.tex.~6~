\section{Introduction}
% eventually look into other alternatives: VoLGA, VoIP (UDP)
The use of mobile communication networks are changing. With new
technologies pushing toward the 5th generation of mobile networks, the
rate at which data is transmitted is increasing and the high user
demands are migrating from a regular circuit- and packet
switched network to a solely packet switched solution, introduced by
\textit{long term evolution}, LTE networks.

For network service providers to ensure their subscribers a good
\textit{quality of service}, QoS, many offer a \textit{circuit
  switched fall-back}, CSFB solution to previous generation networks
which enables backwards compatibility. The fall-back procedure has its
drawbacks and by looking for a better solution, the fifth release of
the 3GPP standards introduced \textit{Internet protocol multimedia
  subsystem}, IMS. IMS is the main element in voice communication over
LTE and this report documents its components and how it allows voice
communication to interconnect between circuit- and packet switched
networks. The result is what is known as \textit{voice over LTE},
VoLTE.

The report is laid out as follows. The basic architecture of LTE and
the appended IP subsystem is introduced in section
\ref{sec:arch}. Section \ref{sec:ims} looks closer at IMS, its
components and what protocols are used in the realization of VoLTE.
Finally, section \ref{sec:conclusion} ends by concluding the findings
of VoLTE and its elements.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

The overall architecture of an LTE network is different than its
predecessors and \textit{circuit switched}, CS communication is no
longer supported. This leaves out the possibility to perform CS voice
calls in a normal LTE network. Instead, voice communication is
possible by using the \textit{Internet protocol}, IP and some
transportation protocol. At the end user, voice data is sampled and
converted to a binary format which is then encapsulated in a packet
and forwarded to the receiver. The packet is routed on the Internet
using a transport protocol, the IP protocol and lower level protocols
depending on the medium. This way, LTE mobile phone users may
communicate with other LTE capable phones or any other device
connected to the Internet. Today, software such as
Skype\footnote{Skype: \url{http://www.skype.com/en/}} and Google
Hangouts\footnote{Google Hangouts:
  \url{http://www.google.com/hangouts/}} provide this type of
communication on multiple platforms.

By looking at the architecture on figure \ref{fig:lte_arch}, just a
few nodes make up the important parts of the access- and core
network.
