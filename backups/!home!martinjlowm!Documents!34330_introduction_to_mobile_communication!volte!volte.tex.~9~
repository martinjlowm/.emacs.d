\section{Introduction}
% eventually look into other alternatives: VoLGA, VoIP (UDP)
The use of mobile communication networks are changing. With new
technologies pushing toward the 5th generation of mobile networks, the
rate at which data is transmitted is increasing and the high user
demands are migrating from a regular circuit- and packet
switched network to a solely packet switched solution, first
introduced by \textit{long term evolution}, LTE networks.

For network service providers to ensure their subscribers a good
\textit{quality of service}, QoS, many offer a \textit{circuit
  switched fall-back}, CSFB solution to previous generation networks
which enables backwards compatibility or a \textit{generic access
  network}, GAN-based solution for dual-mode capable phones using LTE
instead of WiFi. The fall-back procedure has its drawbacks and by
looking for a better solution, the fifth release of the 3GPP standards
introduced \textit{Internet protocol multimedia subsystem}, IMS. IMS
is the main element in voice communication over LTE and this report
documents its components and how it allows voice communication to
interconnect between circuit- and packet switched networks. The result
is what is known as \textit{voice over LTE}, VoLTE.

The report is laid out as follows. The basic architecture of LTE and
the appended IP subsystem is introduced in section
\ref{sec:arch}. Section \ref{sec:ims} looks closer at IMS, its
components and what protocols are used in the realization of VoLTE.
Finally, section \ref{sec:conclusion} ends by concluding the findings
of VoLTE and its elements.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

The overall architecture of an LTE network is different than its
predecessors and \textit{circuit switched}, CS communication is no
longer supported. This leaves out the possibility to perform CS voice
calls in a normal LTE network. Instead, \textit{packet switched}, PS
voice communication is possible by using Internet related
protocols. In a PS conversation between two users, voice data is
sampled and converted to a binary format which is then encapsulated in
a packet and forwarded to the receiver. The packet is routed on the
Internet using a transport protocol, the IP protocol and lower level
protocols depending on the medium. This way, LTE mobile phone users
may communicate with LTE capable phones or any other device
connected to the Internet. Today, software such as
Skype\footnote{Skype: \url{http://www.skype.com/en/}} and Google
Hangouts\footnote{Google Hangouts:
  \url{http://www.google.com/hangouts/}} provide this type of
communication on multiple platforms. This type of communication is
usually referred to as \textit{voice over IP}, VoIP.

By looking at the architecture on figure \ref{fig:lte_arch}, it can be
seen that just a few nodes make up the important parts of the access-
and core network. A cloud of eNodeBs make up the access network and
the \textit{mobility management entity}, MME, \textit{serving
  gateway}, SGW, \textit{packet data network gateway}, PDNGW,
\textit{policy control resource function}, PCRF and \textit{home
  subscription server}, HSS make the core network where the IMS is a
subsystem, as the name implies. The following two subsections look
closer at these networks individually.
\subsection{Access Network}
Like previous generations of mobile networks the outer most node
towards the \textit{user equipment}, UE, is the transceiver and in LTE
it has evolved into an eNodeB which handles additional services such
as radio resources, user scheduling, retransmissions and mobility
management. To fully take advantage of these extra services, a set of
eNodeBs can be interconnected and coordinate its functions through an
X2 interface. This is especially useful in mobility cases with an
ongoing packet based voice call where cached packets can be forwarded
directly to the new serving eNodeB. In cases where eNodeBs aren't
physically connected, mobility management is handled via the MME in
the core network.
