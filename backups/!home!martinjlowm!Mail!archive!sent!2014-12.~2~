All is well, although I've been busy with the semester's last hand-ins
:(

No, not really. I went to talk to Henrik (sorry, I forgot to inform you)
and the deadline for a topic seems to be a general thing on DTU. He told
me that the first week of the 3-week period would be the deadline.

I also asked him what he could think of based on my ideas and the
conclusion was to perhaps get an GSM module, connect it to a computer
and debug/operate the communication using a CMU
(http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/en/product/cmu200-productstartpage_63493-7830.html
e.g.). It didn't sound like Photonics had any particular devices (except
for the CMU) which could be useful for similar cases.

However, this does sound like an easy project and I would like it to be
a challenge.

I didn't look more into the WiFi idea. I'm afraid it would be too
similar to what I did in fagprojekt.

(Also, just to be sure, when I mention Henrik it's Lehrmann
Christiansen, not Wessing :))
